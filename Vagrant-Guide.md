# Virtual Machine Setup
 
You will need to run and compile code for this class in a Linux-based environment. This means you can either ssh onto department machines to work, or you can install Vagrant, a way to manage virtual machines.
 
### What is virtualization?
You’ll no longer have to create a ssh connection or depend on the department machines to run your code
After setting up your VM, you’ll be able to edit files locally and then compile them in your VM with ease.

### Setup
Follow the instructions to [setup Vagrant here](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1310/2020/assign/labs/lab0.html).
CS131 has an awesome guide written, and it’s been tested by a lot of our TAs who have also set it up. This process will take less than thirty minutes and save you a lot of time!

Please use this cs1670-specific [Vagrantfile](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ess476/321a1da04061d8dec24c9f1e9624a2bd/raw/28ebfb144a4f0b3a8d0d6f38388bb40e0e8a78f7/Vagrantfile) (also in the uthreads handout!), instead of the one provided in the guide. 

### Troubleshooting
If you’re on a Mac and VirtualBox fails to install, follow these steps to change your security settings in Systems Preferences.
As always, if you run into any questions or problems, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us on Piazza. Check out this Piazza post for more information and clarifications based on questions from other students so far.
