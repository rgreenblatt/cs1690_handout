# Installation

* We will be using Github classroom to distribute assignments throughout the semester. You can find the link to create a stencil code repository in each project handout. Once you click on the link, the picture you should see something like:

* After clicking “Accept this assignment”, Github will create a private repository unique to you!

* Click on the link highlighted in blue! This will bring you to your own repository with the stencil code imported. Once everything loads, you should be able to view your repository, like the image below.

* Click on the green “Code” button. This will pull up a module with some information on how to get the repository on your local computer from the online repository.

* Click on the clipboard icon to copy and paste the highlighted link. Navigate to the command line. Run: `git clone <what you copy and pasted>`(Please do not click “Download ZIP”. This will download the repository without version control, and render it not possible to submit your solution to Github this way.)

You can now open the folder in your favorite text editor and start coding!


# Handing In

You will be handing in using your Github repository through Gradescope. If this is your first time using Gradescope:
* Please sign up or sign in using your Brown email here
* In order to facilitate anonymous grading, we ask that you edit the Full Name field for your account into an anonymous string, feel free to use something like https://www.random.org/strings/ to generate a random string 
    * Please make sure the email contains your name so we can keep track of who you are and assign you a grade at the end of the semester!

The entry code to the class is **6PGWVW**


Click on the assignment or lab you are submitting for, and you should see the image on the left.
* Under “Submission Method”, please select Github. 
* Under “Repository”, you can search for your repository by typing: 
`brown-cs1690/<project name>-<your Github login>`
* Under “Branch”, you can select any branch that you want to be graded. So if you’re testing something a branch, you can see how its functionality performs here, before merging it to master.

Feel free to upload your assignment as many times as you like before the deadline.

The assignment stencils will come with executables that allow you to test your code in a Linux environment. You can setup a VM, or clone the repository and work over ssh or FastX on the department machines.
