Introduction
============

In this project you will develop and test your very own user-level
threads package complete with thread creation/deletion/joining, mutexes,
condition variables, and a priority-based scheduler. Having completed
this assignment, you should be able to write multi-threaded applications
using your package instead of, say, *pthreads*. 

Run `/course/cs1670/bin/cs1670_install uthreads` to get started. This project is due on **Feb 3rd at 11:59pm**. 

Note: Please **DO NOT** run the handin script (`/course/cs1670/bin/cs1670_handin uthreads`) due to department system issues. We'll let you know once the issue is fixed.

Background
==========

Linux (and most other operating systems) have the notion of a "machine
context" which contains the complete state (at least everything viewable
from user-land) of the CPU at any given time. Usually this includes a
pointer to the stack, register contents, and other bookkeeping
information. The idea is that since contexts contain a complete
description of the CPU state, you should be able to save the current
state and exchange it with another state (which has either been
previously saved or constructed by hand). This enables the operating
system to suspend and resume execution of programs at will, and also
enables you to write a user-land threads package.

Let's try an example. Say you have threads *T<sub>A</sub>*, *T<sub>B</sub>*, and *T<sub>C</sub>* with
contexts *C<sub>A</sub>*, *C<sub>B</sub>*, and *C<sub>C</sub>* of which *T<sub>A</sub>* is currently running.
Say *T<sub>A</sub>* calls `swap(`*C<sub>A</sub>*, *C<sub>B</sub>*`)`, causing the current machine state
to be saved as *C<sub>A</sub>* and the thread *T<sub>B</sub>* to begin executing. *T<sub>B</sub>* then
does a `swap(`*C<sub>B</sub>*, *C<sub>C</sub>*`)`, causing *T<sub>C</sub>* to start running. Eventually
*T<sub>C</sub>* decides that, for whatever reason it wants to allow thread *T<sub>A</sub>*
to run again. When it calls `swap(`*C<sub>C</sub>*, *C<sub>A</sub>*`)`, the machine state that
was previously saved as *C<sub>A</sub>* is restored, and *T<sub>A</sub>* starts running
again. From *T<sub>A</sub>*'s perspective, the call to `swap()` simply did nothing
except pause for some period of time.

It is important to note that context and threads are fundamentally
different things. A context is merely a snapshot of the CPU as it is at
a point in time/code. Threads are a kernel construct that contain a
bunch of other information which is unimportant to the hardware
(scheduling priority, thread state information, `errno`, signal mask,
etc.). Threads contain a context, not the other way around.

The other little bit of magic that you will be (indirectly) employing is
interpositioning, which Professor Doeppner touched on briefly in his
lectures on Linkers and Loaders in CS033. When you run an executable
that is using your *uthreads* package, some system calls will be
interposed on by our wrapper code. This is done so that we can effect
the rescheduling of a thread whenever it calls a system call that would
normally block. In our syscall wrapper, we will call your
`uthread_yield()` function which will cause another, appropriately
prioritized thread to begin executing.

The Assignment
==============

*uthreads* is a user-level threading package which has been loosely
based on the familiar *pthreads* interface. It supports the creation of
threads which can be joined with or detached, a simple priority based
scheduler, mutexes and condition variables. You will be writing the
majority of the *uthreads* code, but your generous TAs have provided you
with some code for dealing with dead threads in addition to some
wrappers around the Linux functions for creating and swapping contexts.
The *uthreads* functions which we give you that you might have to call
yourself are:

```c
// uthread.c
char *alloc_stack();
void free_stack(char*stack);
void make_reapable(uthread_t *uth);

// uthread_ctx.c
void uthread_makecontext(uthread_ctx_t *ctx, char *stack,
                         int stacksz, void (*func)(),
                         long arg1, void *arg2);
void uthread_swapcontext(uthread_ctx_t *oldctx,
                         uthread_ctx_t *newctx);
```

as well as the functions in `uthread_queue.h` and the macros in
`list.h`.

The *uthreads* API functions which you must implement are:

```c
// uthread.c
void uthread_init();
int uthread_create(uthread_id_t *uidp, uthread_func_t func,
                   long arg1, void *arg2, int prio);
void uthread_exit(int status);
int uthread_join(uthread_id_t uid, int *return_value);
int uthread_detach(uthread_id_t uid);
uthread_id_t uthread_alloc();
void uthread_destroy (uthread_t *uth);

// uthread_sched.c
void uthread_yield();
void uthread_block();
void uthread_wake(uthread_t *uthr);
int uthread_setprio(uthread_id_t id, int prio);
void uthread_switch();
void clock_interrupt(int sig);

// uthread_mtx.c
void uthread_mtx_init(uthread_mtx_t *mtx);
void uthread_mtx_lock(uthread_mtx_t *mtx);
int uthread_mtx_trylock(uthread_mtx_t *mtx);
void uthread_mtx_unlock(uthread_mtx_t *mtx);

// uthread_cond.c
void uthread_cond_init(uthread_cond_t *cond);
void uthread_cond_wait(uthread_cond_t *cond,
                       uthread_mtx_t *mtx);
void uthread_cond_broadcast(uthread_cond_t *cond);
void uthread_cond_signal(uthread_cond_t *cond);
```

This may seem like a lot of work, but most of these functions are short.
As a case-in-point, we are providing you with 800+ lines of stencil code
and the TA implementation is less than 1000 lines total. So, while this
assignment contains some concepts that you might not have been exposed
to, it is mercifully short.

These functions are marked by `NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED` macros found in the
code. To see a list of all the functions you still need to implement,
type `make nyi` from the command line, while in the same directory as
the makefile we have included.

Overview
--------

Each of the functions mentioned above has extensive comments in the
source code which explain what is expected of you, but to save you some
time, we will give you a brief summary of how the system works as a
whole.

The first thing that any executable that uses your threads package
should call is `uthread_init()`. This should be called exactly once and
is responsible for setting up all of your data structures such as the
global `uthreads` array and `ut_curthr` (which you should make sure is
always set to the thread that is currently executing). There is some
special code provided for you in `uthread_init()` that will deal with
making the currently executing context (from which the executable just
called `uthread_init()`) a valid uthread and setting up `ut_curthr`. See
the comments around `create_first_thr()` for more information, if you
are interested. Once everything is initialized and `uthread_init` has
completed, you can create threads using `uthread_create()`.

Once you can create threads, you need to schedule them. Whenever a
thread needs to temporarily yield the processor to another thread (but
still remain runnable), it should call `uthread_yield()`. You probably
will not need to call this in your code, but the support code uses it as
a hook to invoke your scheduler inside our syscall wrappers. Threads can
be put to sleep indefinitely and woken up using `uthread_block()` and
`uthread_wake()` respectively. Choosing another thread to run is done
inside the `uthread_switch()` function. Your scheduler should take
thread priorities into account (which are set by `uthread_setprio()`).
To do this, we recommend using a table of separate round-robin queues,
one queue for each priority level. This data structure has been provided
for you as `runq_table` in `uthread_sched.c`.

In general, the *uthreads* assignment has been designed to behave like a
system you are familiar with, *pthreads*. As such, it has functions to
create, detach, and join threads. As with *pthreads*, if an undetached
thread finishes executing, its cleanup should be deferred until a call
to `uthread_join()` is made. The functions for dealing with mutexes and
condition variables should be pretty straightforward as you are familiar
with their expected functionality from the DB assignment. Happily, since
you are writing the scheduling mechanism, you know that a call to
`uthread_cond_wait()` will not return randomly (as it might with
*pthreads*). Therefore, you should not need to use condition variable
guards as much in code which uses *uthreads*.

Assumptions
-----------

A note on some of the assumptions that you may make when writing this
assignment: *uthreads* will never have more than one thread running at
any one time, but threads may be preempted (control can be randomly
taken away from the thread that is running). Handling multiple CPUs (the
ability to run more than one thread concurrently) is beyond the scope of
this assignment. These simplifications allow you to forgo taking locks on global *uthreads*
data structures if you do not call a function that might put the thread
to sleep while modifying the data. This should greatly simplify writing
all the code in this assignment.

Swapping Contexts
-----------------

In *uthreads*, you will use `uthread_makecontext()` to create a machine
context for a thread. When you want to change which thread is currently
executing (i.e.Â in your scheduler), you will need to call
`uthread_swapcontext()`. This will cause the current CPU context to be
saved and a new context to begin executing. The saved context will
resume at a later time when `uthread_swapcontext()` is called with it as
the `newctx` argument.

Time Slicing and Preemption
---------------------------

Previous versions of *uthreads* only allowed for threads to be
de-scheduled if they explicitly `yield`ed the processor. Most interfaces
for threads do not work this way<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>; instead the execution of various
processes are interleaved implicitly by the scheduler.

A common way of implementing this is by time slicing: each thread is
granted a certain amount of time that it can run continuously. After
this time is up, the thread is "preempted" (i.e.Â descheduled) and
another thread allowed to run. This is typically implemented by
scheduling a periodic timer interrupt, and yielding the processor in an
interrupt handler.

You will use interval timers (see `setitimer`) and `SIGVTALRM` to
simulate a timer interrupt; your signal handler will simulate an
interrupt handler.

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: And when they do, they often aren't called threads; more often,
    they are called coroutines

### Dangers of Preemption

Unfortunately, adding preemption to your code does not "just work." Some
routines (think about mutexes) must run to completion without yielding
the processor. Use the `uthread_nopreempt_on/off` functions to maintain
the correctness of key functions. There may be cases with nested preemption;
we deal with this by letting each thread keep track of its own no_prempt_count.

Dealing with Dead Threads: The Reaper
-------------------------------------

As discussed in lecture, the reaper thread is responsible for cleaning
up the resources of unused threads. It is important to note that the
reaper does not fully clean up non-detached threads which have finished
but not yet been joined. Rather, it leaves that work for
`uthread_join()`. We have given you a complete reaper as `reaper` in
`uthread.c`. You should look at it to understand what this means.

Error Reporting
---------------

As a rule, one should use the standard error types defined in `errno.h`
(although it should not be necessary to include this file to use the
values) and as mentioned in the *pthreads* `man` page. The convention we
adopt is to set `errno` to the proper error value and return `-1` from
the function, as with standard system calls.

Compiling and Testing
=====================

Currently, it is not possible to take any (already compiled) program and
have it use *uthreads* instead of *pthreads*. In order to use
*uthreads*, you will need to add all of *uthreads*'s files to its
project, modify it to use the *uthreads* API functions and recompile it.

Debugging
---------

As always, use of `gdb` will make your life much easier when trying to
get this assignment up and running. However, `gdb` can sometimes get
confused in multithreaded programs, and may have trouble printing stack
traces. If that happens, don't worry; it doesn't mean your code is
broken. Also, since *uthreads* is built as a library, `gdb` won't find
the symbols in it right away, so tell it to wait for the "future shared
library to load".

Here's a great little guide on how to use GDB to debug multi-threaded programs: [https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/gdb_pthreads.php](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/gdb_pthreads.php)

Test Code
---------

We can't stress enough how important test code is in an assignment like
this. Without proper test code, finding bugs will be next to impossible.
Make sure to test all sorts of situations with lots of threads at
different priority levels. The `Makefile` included with the assignment
will compile a simple test program which uses the *uthreads* functions,
just to get you started (run `./test` from the directory your *uthreads*
library is in). If it runs and exits cleanly, most of your basic
functionality is working, but be sure to test more complicated cases.

Judicious use of `assert()` will help you both understand your threads
package and debug it. This is your first real systems-level coding
project, and it is highly recommended that you assert a general sane
state of the system whenever you enter a function. Thinking about what a
"sane state" means should lead to a greater understanding of what is
happening at any given time and what could go wrong. A caveat though: if
you have an `assert` that fails in `uthread_yield()`, your program will
enter an infinite loop due to `assert()` calling `write()` calling
`uthread_yield()` and so on.

A final warning: `printf()` is NOT thread-safe. This means that while
your program may appear to be executing incorrectly, it may just be that
the data structures used for buffering are getting clobbered since
`printf()` makes multiple calls to `write()`, and the TA code
interpositions and thus yields control around each individual call to
`write()`. If you are going to write a program to test your *uthreads*,
consider using a combination of `sprintf()` and `write()` like is done
in the test program the TAs provide for you. As described above,
however, `write()` depends on `uthread_yield` and calling it may cause
your program to fail if the scheduler isn't yet fully functional. In
such a situation you will need to use `gdb` to debug your program.
